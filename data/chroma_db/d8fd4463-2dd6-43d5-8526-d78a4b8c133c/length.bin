erences
   its own traceback, which references the locals of all frames caught
   in the traceback.

   See also: Documentation for the "gc" module.

   Warning:

     Due to the precarious circumstances under which "__del__()"
     methods are invoked, exceptions that occur during their execution
     are ignored, and a warning is printed to "sys.stderr" instead.
     In particular:

     * "__del__()" can be invoked when arbitrary code is being
       executed, including from any arbitrary thread.  If "__del__()"
       needs to take a lock or invoke any other blocking resource, it
       may deadlock as the resource may already be taken by the code
       that gets interrupted to execute "__del__()".

     * "__del__()" can be executed during interpreter shutdown.  As a
       consequence, the global variables it needs to access (including
       other modules) may already have been deleted or set to "None".
       Python guarantees that globals whose name begins with a single
       underscore are deleted from their module before other globals
       are deleted; if no other references to such globals exist, this
       may help in assuring that imported modules are still available
       at the time when the "__del__()" method is called.

object.__repr__(self)

   Called by the "repr()" built-in function to compute the ‚Äúofficial‚Äù
   string representation of an object.  If at all possible, this
   should look like a valid Python expression that could be used to
   recreate an object with the same value (given an appropriate
   environment).  If this is not possible, a string of the form
   "<...some useful description...>" should be returned. The return
   value must be a string object. If a class defines "__repr__()" but
   not "__str__()", then "__repr__()" is also used when an ‚Äúinformal‚Äù
   string representation of instances of that class is required.

   This is typically used for debugging, so it is important that the
   representation is information-rich and unambiguous. A default
   implementation is provided by the "object" class itself.

object.__str__(self)

   Called by "str(object)", the default "__format__()" implementation,
   and the built-in function "print()", to compute the ‚Äúinformal‚Äù or
   nicely printable string representation of an object.  The return
   value must be a str object.

   This method differs from "object.__repr__()" in that there is no
   expectation that "__str__()" return a valid Python expression: a
   more convenient or concise representation can be used.

   The default implementation defined by the built-in type "object"
   calls "object.__repr__()".

object.__bytes__(self)

   Called by bytes to compute a byte-string representation of an
   object. This should return a "bytes" object. The "object" class
   itself does not provide this method.

object.__format__(self, format_spec)

   Called by the "format()" built-in function, and by extension,
   evaluation of formatted string literals and the "str.format()"
   method, to produce a ‚Äúformatted‚Äù string representation of an
   object. The *format_spec* argument is a string that contains a
   description of the formatting options desired. The interpretation
   of the *format_spec* argument is up to the type implementing
   "__format__()", however most classes will either delegate
   formatting to one of the built-in types, or use a similar
   formatting option syntax.

   See Format Specification Mini-Language for a description of the
   standard formatting syntax.

   The return value must be a string object.

   The default implementation by the "object" class should be given an
   empty *format_spec* string. It delegates to "__str__()".

   Changed in version 3.4: The __format__ method of "object" itself
   raises a "TypeError" if passed any non-empty string.

   Changed in version 3.7: "object.__format__(x, '')" is now
   equivalent to "str(x)" rather than "format(str(x), '')".

object.__lt__(self, other)
object.__le__(self, other)
object.__eq__(self, other)
object.__ne__(self, other)
object.__gt__(self, other)
object.__ge__(self, other)

   These are the so-called ‚Äúrich comparison‚Äù methods. The
   correspondence between operator symbols and method names is as
   follows: "x<y" calls "x.__lt__(y)", "x<=y" calls "x.__le__(y)",
   "x==y" calls "x.__eq__(y)", "x!=y" calls "x.__ne__(y)", "x>y" calls
   "x.__gt__(y)", and "x>=y" calls "x.__ge__(y)".

   A rich comparison method may return the singleton "NotImplemented"
   if it does not implement the operation for a given pair of
   arguments. By convention, "False" and "True" are returned for a
   successful comparison. However, these methods can return any value,
   so if the comparison operator is used in a Boolean context (e.g.,
   in the condition of an "if" statement), Python will call "bool()"
   on the value to determine if the result is true or false.

   By default, "object" implements "__eq__()" by using "is", returning
   "NotImplemented" in the case of a false comparison: "True if x is y
   else NotImplemented". For "__ne__()", by default it delegates to
   "__eq__()" and inverts the result unless it is "NotImplemented".
   There are no other implied relationships among the comparison
   operators or default implementations; for example, the truth of
   "(x<y or x==y)" does not imply "x<=y". To automatically generate
   ordering operations from a single root operation, see
   "functools.total_ordering()".

   By default, the "object" class provides implementations consistent
   with Value comparisons: equality compares according to object
   identity, and order comparisons raise "TypeError". Each default
   method may generate these results directly, but may also return
   "NotImplemented".

   See the paragraph on "__hash__()" for some important notes on
   creating *hashable* objects which support custom comparison
   operations and are usable as dictionary keys.

   There are no swapped-argument versions of these methods (to be used
   when the left argument does not support the operation but the right
   argument does); rather, "__lt__()" and "__gt__()" are each other‚Äôs
   reflection, "__le__()" and "__ge__()" are each other‚Äôs reflection,
   and "__eq__()" and "__ne__()" are their own reflection. If the
   operands are of different types, and the right operand‚Äôs type is a
   direct or indirect subclass of the left operand‚Äôs type, the
   reflected method of the right operand has priority, otherwise the
   left operand‚Äôs method has priority.  Virtual subclassing is not
   considered.

   When no appropriate method returns any value other than
   "NotImplemented", the "==" and "!=" operators will fall back to
   "is" and "is not", respectively.

object.__hash__(self)

   Called by built-in function "hash()" and for operations on members
   of hashed collections including "set", "frozenset", and "dict".
   The "__hash__()" method should return an integer. The only required
   property is that objects which compare equal have the same hash
   value; it is advised to mix together the hash values of the
   components of the object that also play a part in comparison of
   objects by packing them into a tuple and hashing the tuple.
   Example:

      def __hash__(self):
          return hash((self.name, self.nick, self.color))

   Note:

     "hash()" truncates the value returned from an object‚Äôs custom
     "__hash__()" method to the size of a "Py_ssize_t".  This is
     typically 8 bytes on 64-bit builds and 4 bytes on 32-bit builds.
     If an object‚Äôs   "__hash__()" must interoperate on builds of
     different bit sizes, be sure to check the width on all supported
     builds.  An easy way to do this is with "python -c "import sys;
     print(sys.hash_info.width)"".

   If a class does not define an "__eq__()" method it should not
   define a "__hash__()" operation either; if it defines "__eq__()"
   but not "__hash__()", its instances will not be usable as items in
   hashable collections.  If a class defines mutable objects and
   implements an "__eq__()" method, it should not implement
   "__hash__()", since the implementation of *hashable* collections
   requires that a key‚Äôs hash value is immutable (if the object‚Äôs hash
   value changes, it will be in the wrong hash bucket).

   User-defined classes have "__eq__()" and "__hash__()" methods by
   default (inherited from the "object" class); with them, all objects
   compare unequal (except with themselves) and "x.__hash__()" returns
   an appropriate value such that "x == y" implies both that "x is y"
   and "hash(x) == hash(y)".

   A class that overrides "__eq__()" and does not define "__hash__()"
   will have its "__hash__()" implicitly set to "None".  When the
   "__hash__()" method of a class is "None", instances of the class
   will raise an appropriate "TypeError" when a program attempts to
   retrieve their hash value, and will also be correctly identified as
   unhashable when checking "isinstance(obj,
   collections.abc.Hashable)".

   If a class that overrides "__eq__()" needs to retain the
   implementation of "__hash__()" from a parent class, the interpreter
   must be told this explicitly by setting "__hash__ =
   <ParentClass>.__hash__".

   If a class that does not override "__eq__()" wishes to suppress
   hash support, it should include "__hash__ = None" in the class
   definition. A class which defines its own "__hash__()" that
   explicitly raises a "TypeError" would be incorrectly identified as
   hashable by an "isinstance(obj, collections.abc.Hashable)" call.

   Note:

     By default, the "__hash__()" values of str and bytes objects are
     ‚Äúsalted‚Äù with an unpredictable random value.  Although they
     remain constant within an individual Python process, they are not
     predictable between repeated invocations of Python.This is
     intended to provide protection against a denial-of-service caused
     by carefully chosen inputs that exploit the worst case
     performance of a dict insertion, *O*(*n*^2) complexity.  See
     http://ocert.org/advisories/ocert-2011-003.html for
     details.Changing hash values affects the iteration order of sets.
     Python has never made guarantees about this ordering (and it
     typically varies between 32-bit and 64-bit builds).See also
     "PYTHONHASHSEED".

   Changed in version 3.3: Hash randomization is enabled by default.

object.__bool__(self)

   Called to implement truth value testing and the built-in operation
   "bool()"; should return "False" or "True".  When this method is not
   defined, "__len__()" is called, if it is defined, and the object is
   considered true if its result is nonzero.  If a class defines
   neither "__len__()" nor "__bool__()" (which is true of the "object"
   class itself), all its instances are considered true.
⁄debuggeru´S  "pdb" ‚Äî The Python Debugger
***************************

**Source code:** Lib/pdb.py

======================================================================

The module "pdb" defines an interactive source code debugger for
Python programs.  It supports setting (conditional) breakpoints and
single stepping at the source line level, inspection of stack frames,
source code listing, and evaluation of arbitrary Python code in the
context of any stack frame.  It also supports post-mortem debugging
and can be called under program control.

The debugger is extensible ‚Äì it is actually defined as the class
"Pdb". This is currently undocumented but easily understood by reading
the source.  The extension interface uses the modules "bdb" and "cmd".

See also:

  Module "faulthandler"
     Used to dump Python tracebacks explicitly, on a fault, after a
     timeout, or on a user signal.

  Module "traceback"
     Standard interface to extract, format and print stack traces of
     Python programs.

The typical usage to break into the debugger is to insert:

   import pdb; pdb.set_trace()

Or:

   breakpoint()

at the location you want to break into the debugger, and then run the
program. You can then step through the code following this statement,
and continue running without the debugger using the "continue"
command.

Changed in version 3.7: The built-in "breakpoint()", when called with
defaults, can be used instead of "import pdb; pdb.set_trace()".

   def double(x):
      breakpoint()
      return x * 2
   val = 3
   print(f"{val} * 2 is {double(val)}")

The debugger‚Äôs prompt is "(Pdb)", which is the indicator that you are
in debug mode:

   > ...(3)double()
   -> return x * 2
   (Pdb) p x
   3
   (Pdb) continue
   3 * 2 is 6

Changed in version 3.3: Tab-completion via the "readline" module is
available for commands and command arguments, e.g. the current global
and local names are offered as arguments of the "p" command.

You can also invoke "pdb" from the command line to debug other
scripts.  For example:

   python -m pdb myscript.py

When invoked as a module, pdb will automatically enter post-mortem
debugging if the program being debugged exits abnormally.  After post-
mortem debugging (or after normal exit of the program), pdb will
restart the program.  Automatic restarting preserves pdb‚Äôs state (such
as breakpoints) and in most cases is more useful than quitting the
debugger upon program‚Äôs exit.

Changed in version 3.2: Added the "-c" option to execute commands as
if given in a ".pdbrc" file; see Debugger Commands.

Changed in version 3.7: Added the "-m" option to execute modules
similar to the way "python -m" does. As with a script, the debugger
will pause execution just before the first line of the module.

Typical usage to execute a statement under control of the debugger is:

   >>> import pdb
   >>> def f(x):
   ...     print(1 / x)
   >>> pdb.run("f(2)")
   > <string>(1)<module>()
   (Pdb) continue
   0.5
   >>>

The typical usage to inspect a crashed program is:

   >>> import pdb
   >>> def f(x):
   ...     print(1 / x)
   ...
   >>> f(0)
   Traceback (most recent call last):
     File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
     File "<stdin>", line 2, in f
   ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
   >>> pdb.pm()
   > <stdin>(2)f()
   (Pdb) p x
   0
   (Pdb)

The module defines the following functions; each enters the debugger
in a slightly different way:

pdb.run(statement, globals=None, locals=None)

   Execute the *statement* (given as a string or a code object) under
   debugger control.  The debugger prompt appears before any code is
   executed; you can set breakpoints and type "continue", or you can
   step through the statement using "step" or "next" (all these
   commands are explained below).  The optional *globals* and *locals*
   arguments specify the environment in which the code is executed; by
   default the dictionary of the module "__main__" is used.  (See the
   explanation of the built-in "exec()" or "eval()" functions.)

pdb.runeval(expression, globals=None, locals=None)

   Evaluate the *expression* (given as a string or a code object)
   under debugger control.  When "runeval()" returns, it returns the
   value of the *expression*.  Otherwise this function is similar to
   "run()".

pdb.runcall(function, *args, **kwds)

   Call the *function* (a function or method object, not a string)
   with the given arguments.  When "runcall()" returns, it returns
   whatever the function call returned.  The debugger prompt appears
   as soon as the function is entered.

pdb.set_trace(*, header=None)

   Enter the debugger at the calling stack frame.  This is useful to
   hard-code a breakpoint at a given point in a program, even if the
   code is not otherwise being debugged (e.g. when an assertion
   fails).  If given, *header* is printed to the console just before
   debugging begins.

   Changed in version 3.7: The keyword-only argument *header*.

pdb.post_mortem(traceback=None)

   Enter post-mortem debugging of the given *traceback* object.  If no
   *traceback* is given, it uses the one of the exception that is
   currently being handled (an exception must be being handled if the
   default is to be used).

pdb.pm()

   Enter post-mortem debugging of the traceback found in
   "sys.last_traceback".

The "run*" functions and "set_trace()" are aliases for instantiating
the "Pdb" class and calling the method of the same name.  If you want
to access further features, you have to do this yourself:

class pdb.Pdb(completekey='tab', stdin=None, stdout=None, skip=None, nosigint=False, readrc=True)

   "Pdb" is the debugger class.

   The *completekey*, *stdin* and *stdout* arguments are passed to the
   underlying "cmd.Cmd" class; see the description there.

   The *skip* argument, if given, must be an iterable of glob-style
   module name patterns.  The debugger will not step into frames that
   originate in a module that matches one of these patterns. [1]

   By default, Pdb sets a handler for the SIGINT signal (which is sent
   when the user presses "Ctrl-C" on the console) when you give a
   "continue" command. This allows you to break into the debugger
   again by pressing "Ctrl-C".  If you want Pdb not to touch the
   SIGINT handler, set *nosigint* to true.

   The *readrc* argument defaults to true and controls whether Pdb
   will load .pdbrc files from the filesystem.

   Example call to enable tracing with *skip*:

      import pdb; pdb.Pdb(skip=['django.*']).set_trace()

   Raises an auditing event "pdb.Pdb" with no arguments.

   Changed in version 3.1: Added the *skip* parameter.

   Changed in version 3.2: Added the *nosigint* parameter. Previously,
   a SIGINT handler was never set by Pdb.

   Changed in version 3.6: The *readrc* argument.

   run(statement, globals=None, locals=None)
   runeval(expression, globals=None, locals=None)
   runcall(function, *args, **kwds)
   set_trace()

      See the documentation for the functions explained above.


Debugger Commands
=================

The commands recognized by the debugger are listed below.  Most
commands can be abbreviated to one or two letters as indicated; e.g.
"h(elp)" means that either "h" or "help" can be used to enter the help
command (but not "he" or "hel", nor "H" or "Help" or "HELP").
Arguments to commands must be separated by whitespace (spaces or
tabs).  Optional arguments are enclosed in square brackets ("[]") in
the command syntax; the square brackets must not be typed.
Alternatives in the command syntax are separated by a vertical bar
("|").

Entering a blank line repeats the last command entered.  Exception: if
the last command was a "list" command, the next 11 lines are listed.

Commands that the debugger doesn‚Äôt recognize are assumed to be Python
statements and are executed in the context of the program being
debugged.  Python statements can also be prefixed with an exclamation
point ("!").  This is a powerful way to inspect the program being
debugged; it is even possible to change a variable or call a function.
When an exception occurs in such a statement, the exception name is
printed but the debugger‚Äôs state is not changed.

The debugger supports aliases.  Aliases can have parameters which
allows one a certain level of adaptability to the context under
examination.

Multiple commands may be entered on a single line, separated by ";;".
(A single ";" is not used as it is the separator for multiple commands
in a line that is passed to the Python parser.)  No intelligence is
applied to separating the commands; the input is split at the first
";;" pair, even if it is in the middle of a quoted string. A
workaround for strings with double semicolons is to use implicit
string concatenation "';'';'" or "";"";"".

To set a temporary global variable, use a *convenience variable*. A
*convenience variable* is a variable whose name starts with "$".  For
example, "$foo = 1" sets a global variable "$foo" which you can use in
the debugger session.  The *convenience variables* are cleared when
the program resumes execution so it‚Äôs less likely to interfere with
your program compared to using normal variables like "foo = 1".

There are three preset *convenience variables*:

* "$_frame": the current frame you are debugging

* "$_retval": the return value if the frame is returning

* "$_exception": the exception if the frame is raising an exception

Added in version 3.12: Added the *convenience variable* feature.

If a file ".pdbrc" exists in the user‚Äôs home directory or in the
current directory, it is read with "'utf-8'" encoding and executed as
if it had been typed at the debugger prompt, with the exception that
empty lines and lines starting with "#" are ignored.  This is
particularly useful for aliases.  If both files exist, the one in the
home directory is read first and aliases defined there can be
overridden by the local file.

Changed in version 3.2: ".pdbrc" can now contain commands that
continue debugging, such as "continue" or "next".  Previously, these
commands had no effect.

Changed in version 3.11: ".pdbrc" is now read with "'utf-8'" encoding.
Previously, it was read with the system locale encoding.

h(elp) [command]

   Without argument, print the list of available commands.  With a
   *command* as argument, print help about that command.  "help pdb"
   displays the full documentation (the docstring of the "pdb"
   module).  Since the *command* argument must be an identifier, "help
   exec" must be entered to get help on the "!" command.

w(here)

   Print a stack trace, with the most recent frame at the bottom.  An
   arrow (">") indicates the current frame, which determines the
   context of most commands.

d(own) [count]

   Move the current frame *count* (default one) levels down in the
   stack trace (to a newer frame).

u(p) [count]

   Move the current frame *count* (default one) levels up in the stack
   trace (to an older frame).

b(reak) [([filename:]lineno | function) [, condition]]

   With a *lineno* argument, set a break there in the current file.
   With a *function* argument, set a break at the first executable
   statement within that function.  The line number may be prefixed
   with a filename and a colon, to specify a breakpoint in another
   file (probably one that hasn‚Äôt been loaded yet).  The file is
   searched on "sys.path".  Note that each breakpoint is assigned a
   number to which all the other breakpoint commands refer.

   If a second argument is present, it is an expression which must
   evaluate to true before the breakpoint is honored.

   Without argument, list all breaks, including for each breakpoint,
   the number of times that breakpoint has been hit, the current
   ignore count, and the associated condition if any.

tbreak [([filename:]lineno | function) [, condition]]

   Temporary breakpoint, which is removed automatically when it is
   first hit. The arguments are the same as for "break".

cl(ear) [filename:lineno | bpnumber ...]

   With a *filename:lineno* argument, clear all the breakpoints at
   this line. With a space separated list of breakpoint numbers, clear
   those breakpoints. Without argument, clear all breaks (but first
   ask confirmation).

disable bpnumber [bpnumber ...]

   Disable the breakpoints given as a space separated list of
   breakpoint numbers.  Disabling a breakpoint means it cannot cause
   the program to stop execution, but unlike clearing a breakpoint, it
   remains in the list of breakpoints and can be (re-)enabled.

enable bpnumber [bpnumber ...]

   Enable the breakpoints specified.

ignore bpnumber [count]

   Set the ignore count for the given breakpoint number.  If *count*
   is omitted, the ignore count is set to 0.  A breakpoint becomes
   active when the ignore count is zero.  When non-zero, the *count*
   is decremented each time the breakpoint is reached and the
   breakpoint is not disabled and any associated condition evaluates
   to true.

condition bpnumber [condition]

   Set a new *condition* for the breakpoint, an expression which must
   evaluate to true before the breakpoint is honored.  If *condition*
   is absent, any existing condition is removed; i.e., the breakpoint
   is made unconditional.

commands [bpnumber]

   Specify a list of commands for breakpoint number *bpnumber*.  The
   commands themselves appear on the following lines.  Type a line
   containing just "end" to terminate the commands. An example:

      (Pdb) commands 1
      (com) p some_variable
      (com) end
      (Pdb)

   To remove all commands from a breakpoint, type "commands" and
   follow it immediately with "end"; that is, give no commands.

   With no *bpnumber* argument, "commands" refers to the last
   breakpoint set.

   You can use breakpoint commands to start your program up again.
   Simply use the "continue" command, or "step", or any other command
   that resumes execution.

   Specifying any command resuming execution (currently "continue",
   "step", "next", "return", "jump", "quit" and their abbreviations)
   terminates the command list (as if that command was immediately
   followed by end). This is because any time you resume execution
   (even with a simple next or step), you may encounter another
   breakpoint‚Äîwhich could have its own command list, leading to
   ambiguities about which list to execute.

   If you use the "silent" command in the command list, the usual
   message about stopping at a breakpoint is not printed.  This may be
   desirable for breakpoints that are to print a specific message and
   then continue.  If none of the other commands print anything, you
   see no sign that the breakpoint was reached.

s(tep)

   Execute the current line, stop at the first possible occasion
   (either in a function that is called or on the next line in the
   current function).

n(ext)

   Continue execution until the next line in the current function is
   reached or it returns.  (The difference between "next" and "step"
   is that "step" stops inside a called function, while "next"
   executes called functions at (nearly) full speed, only stopping at
   the next line in the current function.)

unt(il) [lineno]

   Without argument, continue execution until the line with a number
   greater than the current one is reached.

   With *lineno*, continue execution until a line with a number
   greater or equal to *lineno* is reached.  In both cases, also stop
   when the current frame returns.

   Changed in version 3.2: Allow giving an explicit line number.

r(eturn)

   Continue execution until the current function returns.

c(ont(inue))

   Continue execution, only stop when a breakpoint is encountered.

j(ump) lineno

   Set the next line that will be executed.  Only available in the
   bottom-most frame.  This lets you jump back and execute code again,
   or jump forward to skip code that you don‚Äôt want to run.

   It should be noted that not all jumps are allowed ‚Äì for instance it
   is not possible to jump into the middle of a "for" loop or out of a
   "finally" clause.

l(ist) [first[, last]]

   List source code for the current file.  Without arguments, list 11
   lines around the current line or continue the previous listing.
   With "." as argument, list 11 lines around the current line.  With
   one argument, list 11 lines around at that line.  With two
   arguments, list the given range; if the second argument is less
   than the first, it is interpreted as a count.

   The current line in the current frame is indicated by "->".  If an
   exception is being debugged, the line where the exception was
   originally raised or propagated is indicated by ">>", if it differs
   from the current line.

   Changed in version 3.2: Added the ">>" marker.

ll | longlist

   List all source code for the current function or frame.
   Interesting lines are marked as for "list".

   Added in version 3.2.

a(rgs)

   Print the arguments of the current function and their current
   values.

p expression

   Evaluate *expression* in the current context and print its value.

   Note:

     "print()" can also be used, but is not a debugger command ‚Äî this
     executes the Python "print()" function.

pp expression

   Like the "p" command, except the value of *expression* is pretty-
   printed using the "pprint" module.

whatis expression

   Print the type of *expression*.

source expression

   Try to get source code of *expression* and display it.

   Added in version 3.2.

display [expression]

   Display the value of *expression* if it changed, each time
   execution stops in the current frame.

   Without *expression*, list all display expressions for the current
   frame.

   Note:

     Display evaluates *expression* and compares to the result of the
     previous evaluation of *expression*, so when the result is
     mutable, display may not be able to pick up the changes.

   Example:

      lst = []
      breakpoint()
      pass
      lst.append(1)
      print(lst)

   Display won‚Äôt realize "lst" has been changed because the result of
   evaluation is modified in place by "lst.append(1)" before being
   compared:

      > example.py(3)<module>()
      -> pass
      (Pdb) display lst
      display lst: []
      (Pdb) n
      > example.py(4)<module>()
      -> lst.append(1)
      (Pdb) n
      > example.py(5)<module>()
      -> print(lst)
      (Pdb)

   You can do some tricks with copy mechanism to make it work:

      > example.py(3)<module>()
      -> pass
      (Pdb) display lst[:]
      display lst[:]: []
      (Pdb) n
      > example.py(4)<module>()
      -> lst.append(1)
      (Pdb) n
      > example.py(5)<module>()
      -> print(lst)
      display lst[:]: [1]  [old: []]
      (Pdb)

   Added in version 3.2.

undisplay [expression]

   Do not display *expression* anymore in the current frame.  Without
   *expression*, clear all display expressions for the current frame.

   Added in version 3.2.

interact

   Start an interactive interpreter (using the "code" module) whose
   global namespace contains all the (global and local) names found in
   the current scope.

   Added in version 3.2.

alias [name [command]]

   Create an alias called *name* that executes *command*.  The
   *command* must *not* be enclosed in quotes.  Replaceable parameters
   can be indicated by "%1", "%2", and so on, while "%*" is replaced
   by all the parameters. If *command* is omitted, the current alias
   for *name* is shown. If no arguments are given, all aliases are
   listed.

   Aliases may be nested and can contain anything that can be legally
   typed at the pdb prompt.  Note that internal pdb commands *can* be
   overridden by aliases.  Such a command is then hidden until the
   alias is removed.  Aliasing is recursively applied to the first
   word of the command line; all other words in the line are left
   alone.

   As an example, here are two useful aliases (especially when placed
   in the ".pdbrc" file):

      # Print instance variables (usage "pi classInst")
      alias pi for k in %1.__dict__.keys(): print(f"%1.{k} = {%1.__dict__[k]}")
      # Print instance variables in self
      alias ps pi self

unalias name

   Delete the specified alias *name*.

! statement

   Execute the (one-line) *statement* in the context of the current
   stack frame. The exclamation point can be omitted unless the first
   word of the statement resembles a debugger command, e.g.:

      (Pdb) ! n=42
      (Pdb)

   To set a global variable, you can prefix the assignment command
   with a "global" statement on the same line, e.g.:

      (Pdb) global list_options; list_options = ['-l']
      (Pdb)

run [args ...]
restart [args ...]

   Restart the debugged Python program.  If *args* is supplied, it is
   split with "shlex" and the result is used as the new "sys.argv".
   History, breakpoints, actions and debugger options are preserved.
   "restart" is an alias for "run".

q(uit)

   Quit from the debugger.  The program being executed is aborted.

debug code

   Enter a recursive debugger that steps through *code* (which is an
   arbitrary expression or statement to be executed in the current
   environment).

retval

   Print the return value for the last return of the current function.

[1] Whether a frame is considered to originate in a certain module is
    determined by the "__name__" in the frame globals.
⁄dela©  The "del" statement
*******************

   del_stmt ::= "del" target_list

Deletion is recursively defined very similar to the way assignment is
defined. Rather than spelling it out in full details, here are some
hints.

Deletion of a target list recursively deletes each target, from left
to right.

Deletion of a name removes the binding of that name from the local or
global namespace, depending on whether the name occurs in a "global"
statement in the same code block.  If the name is unbound, a
"NameError" exception will be raised.

Deletion of attribute references, subscriptions and slicings is passed
to the primary object involved; deletion of a slicing is in general
equivalent to assignment of an empty slice of the right type (but even
this is determined by the sliced object).

Changed in version 3.2: Previously it was illegal to delete a name
from the local namespace if it occurs as a free variable in a nested
block.
⁄dictu  Dictionary displays
*******************

A dictionary display is a possibly empty series of dict items
(key/value pairs) enclosed in curly braces:

   dict_display       ::= "{" [dict_item_list | dict_comprehension] "}"
   dict_item_list     ::= dict_item ("," dict_item)* [","]
   dict_item          ::= expression ":" expression | "**" or_expr
   dict_comprehension ::= expression ":" expression comp_for

A dictionary display yields a new dictionary object.

If a comma-separated sequence of dict items is given, they are
evaluated from left to right to define the entries of the dictionary:
each key object is used as a key into the dictionary to store the
corresponding value.  This means that you can specify the same key
multiple times in the dict item list, and the final dictionary‚Äôs value
for that key will be the last one given.

A double asterisk "**" denotes *dictionary unpacking*. Its operand
must be a *mapping*.  Each mapping item is added to the new
dictionary.  Later values replace values already set by earlier dict
items and earlier dictionary unpackings.

Added in version 3.5: Unpacking into dictionary displays, originally
proposed by **PEP 448**.

A dict comprehension, in contrast to list and set comprehensions,
needs two expressions separated with a colon followed by the usual
‚Äúfor‚Äù and ‚Äúif‚Äù clauses. When the comprehension is run, the resulting
key and value elements are inserted in the new dictionary in the order
they are produced.

Restrictions on the types of the key values are listed earlier in
section The standard type hierarchy.  (To summarize, the key type
should be *hashable*, which excludes all mutable objects.)  Clashes
between duplicate keys are not detected; the last value (textually
rightmost in the display) stored for a given key value prevails.

Changed in version 3.8: Prior to Python 3.8, in dict comprehensions,
the evaluation order of key and value was not well-defined.  In
CPython, the value was evaluated before the key.  Starting with 3.8,
the key is evaluated before the value, as proposed by **PEP 572**.
zdynamic-featuresa∞  Interaction with dynamic features
*********************************

Name resolution of free variables occurs at runtime, not at compile
time. This means that the following code will print 42:

   i = 10
   def f():
       print(i)
   i = 42
   f()

The "eval()" and "exec()" functions do not have access to the full
environment for resolving names.  Names may be resolved in the local
and global namespaces of the caller.  Free variables are not resolved
in the nearest enclosing namespace, but in the global namespace.  [1]
The "exec()" and "eval()" functions have optional arguments to
override the global and local namespace.  If only one namespace is
specified, it is used for both.
⁄elseaX  The "if" statement
******************

The "if" statement is used for conditional execution:

   if_stmt ::= "if" assignment_expression ":" suite
               ("elif" assignment_expression ":" suite)*
               ["else" ":" suite]

It selects exactly one of the suites by evaluating the expressions one
by one until one is found to be true (see section Boolean operations
for the definition of true and false); then that suite is executed
(and no other part of the "if" statement is executed or evaluated).
If all expressions are false, the suite of the "else" clause, if
present, is executed.

exceptionsuö  Exceptions
**********

Exceptions are a means of breaking out of the normal flow of control
of a code block in order to handle errors or other exceptional
conditions.  An exception is *raised* at the point where the error is
detected; it may be *handled* by the surrounding code block or by any
code block that directly or indirectly invoked the code block where
the error occurred.

The Python interpreter raises an exception when it detects a run-time
error (such as division by zero).  A Python program can also
explicitly raise an exception with the "raise" statement. Exception
handlers are specified with the "try" ‚Ä¶ "except" statement.  The
"finally" clause of such a statement can be used to specify cleanup
code which does not handle the exception, but is executed whether an
exception occurred or not in the preceding code.

Python uses the ‚Äútermination‚Äù model of error handling: an exception
handler can find out what happened and continue execution at an outer
level, but it cannot repair the cause of the error and retry the
failing operation (except by re-entering the offending piece of code
from the top).

When an exception is not handled at all, the interpreter terminates
execution of the program, or returns to its interactive main loop.  In
either case, it prints a stack traceback, except when the exception is
"SystemExit".

Exceptions are identified by class instances.  The "except" clause is
selected depending on the class of the instance: it must reference the
class of the instance or a *non-virtual base class* thereof. The
instance can be received by the handler and can carry additional
information about the exceptional condition.

Note:

  Exception messages are not part of the Python API.  Their contents
  may change from one version of Python to the next without warning
  and should not be relied on by code which will run under multiple
  versions of the interpreter.

See also the description of the "try" statement in section The try
statement and "raise" statement in section The raise statement.

-[ Footnotes ]-

[1] This limitation occurs because the code that is executed by these
    operations is not available at the time the module is compiled.

***************


Structure of a program
======================

A Python program is constructed from code blocks. A *block* is a piece
of Python program text that is executed as a unit. The following are
blocks: a module, a function body, and a class definition. Each
command typed interactively is a block.  A script file (a file given
as standard input to the interpreter or specified as a command line
argument to the interpreter) is a code block.  A script command (a
command specified on the interpreter command line with the "-c"
option) is a code block. A module run as a top level script (as module
"__main__") from the command line using a "-m" argument is also a code
block. The string argument passed to the built-in functions "eval()"
and "exec()" is a code block.

A code block is executed in an *execution frame*.  A frame contains
some administrative information (used for debugging) and determines
where and how execution continues after the code block‚Äôs execution has
completed.
